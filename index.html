        <h1>WHITNEY MUSEUM VISIT</h1>
        <p>One rainy afternoon, I visited the Whitney Museum of American Art. I viewed the Spilling Over Painting Color of the 1960s, and Where Are We: Collections from the Whitney's Collection exhibits. I was taken back by how abstract and colorful some of the pieces were. I am a huge fan of street art and canvases, which made my experience so much better. 
        
        Issac Soyer's Employment Agency (1937), Raphael Soyer's Office Girls (1936), and Charles Henry Alston's, The Family (1955) were my favorite pieces. Each one grabbed my attention and reminded me of how powerful and important African American women are in the world and our history, despite what society may believe.</p>
